# RetOS

A Router Network Operating System. RetOS comes from *retis* which mean *network* in Latin.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a PhD project, and it is still very WIP.

> [!NOTE]
> This Operating System is based on the great [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/) from [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp). 

## How to use

### Development

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will need QEMU x86_64 in order to run project in development mode
> - [Download for Linux](https://www.qemu.org/download/#linux) 
> - [Download for MacOS](https://www.qemu.org/download/#macos)
> - [Download for Windows](https://www.qemu.org/download/#windows)
> - [Install with Nix](https://search.nixos.org/packages?show=qemu)
> 
> You can check the command is available by running
> ```shell
> qemu-system-x86_64 --version
> ```

Run the project with QEMU

```shell
cargo run
```

> [!NOTE]
> If further toolchain installation is needed, `rust-toolchain.toml` depicts what's needed.

### Production

By running the following command, you will build the OS images and the executables that will use QEMU.

```shell
cargo build --release
```

If you need the images (`.img` files), you can find them like so:

```shell
find ./target/release -name "retos-*.img"
```
